Hi, I'm Michael Tempesta, and I'm passionate about using technology to create innovative solutions that make people's lives better. As a co-founder of Spoofs, I've had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge AI technologies to create a unique app that uses voice-synthesis for parody and social media. It's been an exciting journey, and I've learned a lot about how AI can be used to enhance our experiences and interactions with technology.

In addition to my work on the app, I also have experience with Python and machine learning libraries, which I've used to build and train custom models for various projects. I enjoy exploring the potential of AI to solve complex problems and create new opportunities for businesses and individuals.

As a front-end developer, I also have a keen eye for design and user experience, and I strive to create intuitive, engaging interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

If you're interested in learning more about my work or have a project you'd like to collaborate on, feel free to get in touch!
